Updates to the PointNet model that were made to the PointNet source-code in https://github.com/charlesq34/pointnet are documented in the README_PointNet_Updates.ipynb.

The original PointNet model can be run with the PointNet_Wrapper.ipynb. 

PointNet++ can be run with the PointNetv2_Pytorch_wrapper.ipynb. For the PointNet++ wrapper implementation, no additional source-code changes were made beyond the pull request from https://github.com/yanx27/Pointnet_Pointnet2_pytorch implementation to modernize the PointNet++ approach for Python3.0 and adverse symptoms with depreciated CUDA and TensorFlow versions.

Results and additional documentaiton and analyses can be found documented in ME_592_HW4.docx.
